If you've spent 15 minutes working on something and are stuck, don't keep working on it. ASK FOR HELP. To get help in this course, you have three main options:

1. Contact Dr. Love and the Teaching Assistant (Wyatt Bensken) by email at **500-help at case dot edu**. Wyatt will also hold office hours.

2. Dr. Love will also hold "office hours" for the 15 minutes before and after each class on Zoom.

3. Email Dr. Love at **Thomas dot Love at case dot edu** with any individual concerns related to the course that you cannot ask elsewhere, if you have any special concerns or needs that you want him to know about, or to set up an appointment with him for a Zoom meeting.
