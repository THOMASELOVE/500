- The Zoom link for each class will be [available on Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu) in the Zoom section. Zoom recordings will also be posted to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).
    - Some assignments (essays, OSIA slides) are submitted via the Class Shared Google Drive, and details on accessing that will be available at our first class session. 
    - Other assignments (labs and some project materials) are to be submitted to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

## Readings

During the course, we will read Paul Rosenbaum's book **Observation and Experiment: An Introduction to Causal Inference**, which is available as an e-book or in paperback for under $25. Please buy the book and read the Preface and Chapter 1 before our first class on 2020-02-04.
